# brew
## how to use brew downloaded packages, commands instead of builtins?
The `/usr/local/bin` path variable should come before `/usr/bin`
If the command does not update, exit the shell and re-login.
If you want to see all the redundant packages
`type -a mycommand`
This will list all the packages available regardless of the order of path.
