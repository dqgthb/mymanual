tried to migrate to pycharm

was looking for an matlab-like developing environment with variable explorers, etc.

could replace `main` function with `execfile("main.py")`, which is a bit cumbersome but fine.

however, couldn't stop vim emulator inside the python console window, which prevents me from sending keyboard interrupt via ctrl-c.

This is a serious bug. I decided to quit pycharm.

maybe I should use spyder.

But wait, it seems that spyder has the same bug. Nevermind, someone's gonna fix it.

spyder is unfunded since the late 2017? Now, what should I do?
